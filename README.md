# 🚦 Road Accident Analysis Project (Excel + Power Query)

## 🎯 Project Objective
To analyze and visualize road accident data across key factors (severity, vehicle type, road type, lighting, and area type) in order to identify patterns, highlight risks, and support data-driven road safety decisions.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- Number of rows : 660,680

- Number of columns: 14

## 🧹 1. Data Cleaning (Power Query)

1. Changed column data types.  
2. Inserted Year, Day Name, and Week Type columns.  
3. Reordered and filtered columns/rows.  
4. Removed unnecessary columns (Latitude, Longitude, extra fields).  
5. Split and renamed columns for clarity.  
6. Replaced inconsistent values (road, weather, light conditions).  
7. Standardized text format (lowercase).  
8. Added conditional column (Vehicle Type).  
9. Final cleanup: removed unused columns.

## 📊 2. Data Analysis (PivotTables)

- Compared **casualties vs. accidents** to measure severity.  
- Analyzed accident counts by **road type, weather, and light conditions**.  
- Identified **Birmingham** as the most affected city.  
- Tracked **seasonal trends**, showing a spike in summer months.  
- Examined **vehicle involvement**, with private cars leading most cases.

## 📈 3. Dashboard (Excel)

### 🔑 Key KPIs
- **Total Accidents:** 307,573  
- **Total Casualties:** 417,883  

### 📉 Charts & Visuals
- Accident distribution by **road type** and **weather condition**.  
- **Hotspot analysis** (e.g., Birmingham as the top city).  
- **Temporal patterns**: daylight vs. darkness, weekday vs. weekend.  
- **Seasonal trends**: spike in summer months.  
- **Vehicle involvement**: cars vs. other vehicle types.  

---

## 🔍 4. Key Insights

- **Casualties exceed accidents**: Each accident results in more than one casualty on average.  
- **Minor casualties dominate**: Over 80% of casualties are classified as *slight*.  
- **Single carriageways**: Most dangerous road type, followed by dual carriageways.  
- **Urban daytime crashes**: Most accidents occur in urban areas and during daylight.  
- **Fair weather risk**: Majority of accidents happen in fine weather.  
- **Seasonal spike**: Summer months record the highest accident numbers.  
- **Cars lead**: Private cars are the most common vehicle type involved.

## 🛠️ 5. Recommendations

1. **Target high-risk areas**: Prioritize Birmingham with awareness campaigns, extra patrols, and hotspot analysis.  
2. **Address driver behavior**: Focus on overconfidence in fine weather; run campaigns targeting private car drivers.  
3. **Improve road infrastructure**: Enhance safety on single and dual carriageways (signs, barriers, speed adjustments).  
4. **Leverage seasonal data**: Increase monitoring and launch summer-specific safety advisories.
